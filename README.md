algorithms
==========

A c++ implementation of different algorithms and data structures.

I make generous use of C++ STL and all data structures are designed to be used as is and are templated wherever applicable 
and can be readily used in your own projects.

It contains the following data structures and algorithms as of now and is more will be coming each day.

* Strings - Reversal, permutations, basic string compression, Anagram testing
* Sorting - Merge sort, randomized quick sort, median-of-3 quick sort
* Linked Lists - insertion, deletion, detecting cycles, detecting palindromes
* Stacks - Towers of hanoi problem, Min-stack, Set of stacks, Three-in-one stack, Computation of max-area under histogram using stacks, Stacks using queues
* Queues - insertion, deletion, Queues using stacks
* Binary Trees - Tree traversals - in order, pre order, post order, get levels in a tree, ancestry, balance, height, diameter computation
* Binary Search Trees - insertion, deletion, search, successor, converting to sorted linked list
* Heaps - construction, insertion, extract-min, deletion, increase key, finding top k elements
* Graphs - BFS, DFS, Finding minimum cuts using kragers algorithm, Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
* Selection - Randomized selection in linear time
* Divide and Conquer paradigm - Karatsuba integer multiplication, closest pair points in 2-dimensional plane, Counting inversions
* Integer arrays - partitioning arrays, longest increasing sub sequence, subset with sum on bounded sum arrays, max product sub array problem,
                   maximum number of overlapping intervals problem
* Dynamic Programming - Fibonacci number computation, Longest common subsequence, Largest sum subsequence, Edit distance problem
                        Minimum coins required to provide a sum
* Data structures - LRU Cache
